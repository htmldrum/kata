Jasmine
==============================

- BDD for JS
- Suites begin with call to 'describe' global
	- String description
	- function implements the suite
- Specs begin with call to 'it' global
	- contains 1 or more expectations: true or false
	- spec with all true expectations passes
- Expectations begin with 'expect', chained with a Matcher function which takes the expected value. Chaining multiple matchers together together.

	`describe("A suite is just a function", function() {
    var a;
	  
    it("and so is a spec", function() {
      a = true;
	  
      expect(a).toBe(true);
    });
  });`
- Setup/Teardown
	- beforeEach
	- afterEach
		- around each spec
	- beforeAll
	- afterAll
	  - around each suite
  - These fn's modify variables within the scope of the describe block
	- can use the 'this' namespace to share variables between specs
- Nesting describes
	- able to share context with parents
- disable suites: xdescribe
- disable spec: xit
- pending: calling pending('description') within a spec body will mark the entire spec as pending
- Spies
	- Test doubles
	- Stubs any function and tracks calls to its arguments
	- allows specing function evaluation
- jasmine.any
	- takes a constructor or class name as a value and returns true if the constructor matches the constructor of the value
