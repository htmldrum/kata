docker-rails
==============================

A repo for playing around with Docker/Rails environments

# TODO

- Make development less painful
  - Why is bundle run as root? Forces restarts/permissions issues each time something is invoked
  - May be able to get around it by defining data model up front and plowing through it
- Boot single rails app
- Boot multi-tenated applications
- Integrate GitHub
